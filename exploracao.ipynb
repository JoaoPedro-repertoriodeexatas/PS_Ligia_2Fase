              "28555  Vatican upbeat on possibility of Pope Francis visiting Russia                                             MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said on Tuesday that there was  positive momentum  behind the idea of Pope Francis visiting Russia, but suggested there was more work to be done if it were to happen.  Parolin, speaking at a joint news conference in Moscow alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, did not give any date for such a possible visit. The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity split apart in 1054. The pope, leader of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics, is seeking to improve ties, and last year in Cuba held what was the first ever meeting between a Roman Catholic pope and a Russian Orthodox patriarch.  Parolin said he had also used his talks in the Russian capital to also raise certain difficulties faced by the Catholic Church in Russia. He said that Moscow and the Vatican disagreed about the plight of Christians in certain parts of the world. He did not elaborate. Parolin, who is due later on Tuesday to meet Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, said he also believed Russia could play an important role when it came to helping solve a crisis in Venezuela because of its close relations with Caracas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         worldnews  August 22, 2017    0        1\n",

              "4       WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Very Upset Hillary Clinton Is Not Doing Trump’s Job                              White House counselor Kellyanne Conway crawled out of her crypt after two weeks in hiding to attack Hillary Clinton who is totally not the President. Former reality show star Donald Trump was sworn in 216 days ago (seems longer, huh?) and his administration is still talking about his former rival. It s not too surprising since Trump is still in campaign mode, holding rallies, likely because he still doesn t know how to President.On Thursday, Conway appeared on  Fox & Friends  to lash out at Trump s critics, the media, and Hillary Clinton for daring to write a book because books are bad, apparently. Where s her big c4 trying to help women and children around the globe?  Conway asked as if the Clinton Foundation which helps women and children around the globe does not exist.Conway then just wondered why Clinton is not doing Trump s job. Where s her bipartisan effort to try to help with infrastructure and meaningful tax reform, or the opioid crisis that I work on in the building behind me every single day?  Conway asked.Trump s policies and attempted legislation have failed to pass. There s been an exodus of staffers at various councils after his appalling speech on the Charlottesville attack which left one dead and 19 others injured. Thanks, Hillary!Someone, please tell Trump that Hillary Clinton is not holding an elected office. Passing infrastructure bills and handling the opioid crisis is all on Trump. Eradicating Obamacare would have a devastating effect on those suffering from the disease of addiction who wish to get treatment. Thanks again, Hillary.Conway then claimed that Hillary Clinton  failed to make history,  even though she won the popular vote and was the first woman to become the presidential nominee of a major party in the U.S.Watch: It s way over the line.   @KellyannePolls reacts to James Clapper questioning Pres. Trump s fitness for office pic.twitter.com/w4Db17t6g5  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 24, 2017But Trump has tried to claim repeatedly that he won the popular vote (he did not win the popular vote) but thanks for weighing in, Kellyanne.

In the middle of Sander s speech, a small and beautiful bird floated down and joined him on the podium.This is not some Matthew Bay-level CGI effect   it actually happened. Sanders broke off mid-speech as the bird hovered around above him, and the packed stadium laughed and applauded. But then, to everyone s surprise, the bird actually flew down and settled on the lectern. I think there s some symbolism here,  Sanders said.  That little bird is really a dove asking us for world peace. This sent the crowd into uproar, and the meme-makers went into overdrive.There was some speculation about what would have happened to the poor bird if it had innocently flapped its way into a Trump rally.@politico If this was a Trump rally.. his goons would beat it up or one of the cult members would shoot it  Greg King (@Megreg916) March 25, 2016And the whole affair is certainly not going to help Portland rid itself of the Portlandia gag #PutABirdOnIt.A little bird told me that @BernieSanders is really a Disney Princess.Also Portland you're taking that #PutABirdOnIt thing way too serious  kelly kapowski (@Colo_Kelly) March 25, 2016For those who missed that joke.

              "20      Elijah Cummings Made Sure The GOP Is Well Aware They’re Hypocritical A**holes Regarding Flint            There seems to be a definite double standard when it comes to how Republicans in Congress want to go about investigating terrible governors. When it came to investigating former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber (D), Republicans like Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) were fast and furious with their requests to obtain the information they wanted in regards to a scandal surrounding Oregon s health insurance exchange. However, when it comes to going after Republican Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan over the horrendous Flint water crisis, those same Republicans so adamant at going after a Democratic governor, failed to send requests to investigate Flint.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) is not about to let them get away with this hypocrisy whatsoever.In a letter sent by Cummings to Chaffetz, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Cummings points out the clear double-standard of the committee going after Kitzhaber, but not Snyder in the same regard. And while Cummings does give them some credit for called Snyder before the Committee in March, it is clear that they are not going after Snyder with the same vigor. Cummings wrote: During our meeting last week, you explained that you had spoken directly with Governor Snyder, and you suggested that one reason not to request documents from him is because he might claim that his communications about the Flint water crisis are protected by executive privilege. Although I was not a part of your conversation with Governor Snyder, any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from Congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the Governor s own promises of accountability to the people of Michigan. Cummings also wrote: I believe that the Committee should apply the same standards for requesting documents to all governors, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. By declining to send any document request at all to Governor Snyder, the Committee is creating the perception of a double-standard in which it has requested documents from a Democratic governor, but not from a Republican governor. He then goes on to give the example of former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber.It is simply woefully irresponsible to so blatantly neglect going after Gov. Snyder, especially considering the Flint, Michigan water crisis is so irreversibly severe causing lifelong health issues to those affected. Not only should they be investigating Snyder to the fullest extent, but they should be pushing for his resignation, as is what happened with Kitzhaber.Cummings sums it up best when he states: The Committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation, and we should not do so now. Governor Snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision-making process that led to the poisoning of Flint residents, and the Committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation. Snyder needs to be held responsible and party politics need to be checked at the door. End of story.Featured image via YouTube                                                                                                                                                                                       News       February 22, 2016  1        1\n",
              "19      Chris Cuomo SLAMS Trump For Promising “A Lot Of Things That Can’t Be Done” In Energy Speech (VIDEO)      Earlier this week, Donald Trump made a speech in Bismarck, North Dakota to talk about his energy policy. While it might have been refreshing for the business mogul to actually talk about a policy instead of attacking his Democratic rivals, saying offensive things about women and minorities or retweeting white supremacists, it s safe to say Trump s supporters should hold off on getting too excited over anything he says   because it s all false promises.During Trump s speech, Trump promised American voters that he would cancel the crucial 2015 Paris agreement that binds all nations to the common goal of tackling climate change, and that he d  rescind  the EPA rules that President Barack Obama set up to decrease emissions from coal-fired power plants. If it sounds improbable, that s because it pretty much is   and no one was faster to point this out that CNN s Chris Cuomo on Friday. In speaking with Trump s campaign senior advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Cuomo criticized the GOP candidate for his sloppy ideas. He said: Donald Trump put out a big speech about his energy policy, about coal, about oil, about regulation. And the criticism of it is that he proposed a lot of things that can t be done. You can t get rid of all of the EPA regulations. You can t just make coal as huge as it once was. There are good and bad reasons for that. Fair criticisms that the proposal can t do what Donald Trump says it will do. Huckabee Sanders argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has to be  reined in and brought back down.  She said: I think there are some big things you can do, and exactly what Donald Trump said is we need to move to an all-of-the-above approach. The Obama administration and his energy policy has been job-killing, [has] raised energy costs across America, has been horrible for our country, so we ve got to go back to where we put all options on the table. Huckabee Sanders continued to diss Obama and added that, We ve got to absolutely reverse what has taken place over the last eight years under the Obama administration by taking away the energy independence that Americans have enjoyed and making us more dependent on foreign energy and go back to where we can energize our own country on our own. Cuomo fired back, stating that the EPA wasn t perfect, just like  every government agency.  He continued: But reducing fossil fuel dependence is a very popular thing in America, and that s a big part of the regulations, and in terms of energy independence, the United States right now puts out 74 percent of its oil needs. I mean, I guess you could go to 100 percent, but the idea that we re somehow, you know, really deficient in terms of how much of our own needs we provide for, it s just not true.  Huckabee Sanders continued to try and counter attack, but Cuomo shut her down every time with realistic scenarios and facts. You can watch Cuomo blast Trump s policies below: Trump s energy policy speech came just a day before Trump told drought-stricken Californians that the extreme water shortage they ve been experiencing doesn t really exist, and offered a conspiracy theory as an alternative explanation. Clearly, Trump isn t someone that we can trust for environmental or energy issues.Featured image is a screenshot  News       May 28, 2016       1        1\n",
              "18      Leslie Knope Writes Powerful, Heartbreaking Letter To America That EVERYONE Should Read                  Who doesn t love Leslie Knope? She even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian Ron Swanson.Parks and Recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in America, in fact   especially millennials. And no character is more beloved than Amy Poehler s Leslie Knope.For many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly Knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. However, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. You can read my favorite passage below:Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron s words)  significant.  My bargaining was short, but creative  I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but I didn t care, in that moment.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to Acceptance. And here s what I stand on that:No. I do not accept it.I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the President. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I m pissed, and I m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) Our President-Elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.I highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   Leslie is exactly right. It s time for us to fight harder than ever.                                                                             News       November 10, 2016  1        1\n",
              "15      Watch Hillary’s Reaction When Security Tries To Kick Shirtless Male Supporters Out Of Her Rally          Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton had a couple of really enthusiastic supporters show up at her Buena Park, California rally on Wednesday. In fact, they were so enthusiastic she had to stop her security team from throwing them out of the event because they decided to remove their shirts.As security moved to escort the shirtless men out of her rally, one of them yelled,  Hillary, they re kicking us out because we don t have our shirts on. They re making us leave because we don t have shirts on.  A laughing Clinton responded by asking security to stop and saying: Well, you know what? As long as they don t take anything else off. You know, you gotta make split decisions that s what leadership is all about. We are a big diverse country. OK, where was I? I gotta admit, it is a little distracting standing up here looking at them. So I m gonna look over this way, and I m gonna look over that way. I m gonna look back there. It was a great moment for Clinton to show off the sense of humor a lot of people do not realize she has. The right wing often accuses her of being an Ice Queen, but she is actually very funny. Her response also highlighted the vast differences between her campaign and that of Republican nominee Donald Trump. The GOP candidate s rallies are filled with violence and hate, while Clinton s is filled with positivity. It s like night and day.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            News       May 26, 2016       1        1\n",

              "      <th>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said on Tuesday that there was  positive momentum  behind the idea of Pope Francis visiting Russia, but suggested there was more work to be done if it were to happen.  Parolin, speaking at a joint news conference in Moscow alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, did not give any date for such a possible visit. The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity split apart in 1054. The pope, leader of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics, is seeking to improve ties, and last year in Cuba held what was the first ever meeting between a Roman Catholic pope and a Russian Orthodox patriarch.  Parolin said he had also used his talks in the Russian capital to also raise certain difficulties faced by the Catholic Church in Russia. He said that Moscow and the Vatican disagreed about the plight of Christians in certain parts of the world. He did not elaborate. Parolin, who is due later on Tuesday to meet Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, said he also believed Russia could play an important role when it came to helping solve a crisis in Venezuela because of its close relations with Caracas.</th>\n",

Former reality show star Donald Trump was sworn in 216 days ago (seems longer, huh?) and his administration is still talking about his former rival. It s not too surprising since Trump is still in campaign mode, holding rallies, likely because he still doesn t know how to President.On Thursday, Conway appeared on  Fox &amp; Friends  to lash out at Trump s critics, the media, and Hillary Clinton for daring to write a book because books are bad, apparently. Where s her big c4 trying to help women and children around the globe?  Conway asked as if the Clinton Foundation which helps women and children around the globe does not exist.Conway then just wondered why Clinton is not doing Trump s job. Where s her bipartisan effort to try to help with infrastructure and meaningful tax reform, or the opioid crisis that I work on in the building behind me every single day?  Conway asked.Trump s policies and attempted legislation have failed to pass. There s been an exodus of staffers at various councils after his appalling speech on the Charlottesville attack which left one dead and 19 others injured. Thanks, Hillary!Someone, please tell Trump that Hillary Clinton is not holding an elected office. Passing infrastructure bills and handling the opioid crisis is all on Trump. Eradicating Obamacare would have a devastating effect on those suffering from the disease of addiction who wish to get treatment. Thanks again, Hillary.Conway then claimed that Hillary Clinton  failed to make history,  even though she won the popular vote and was the first woman to become the presidential nominee of a major party in the U.S.Watch: It s way over the line.   @KellyannePolls reacts to James Clapper questioning Pres.

But then, to everyone s surprise, the bird actually flew down and settled on the lectern. I think there s some symbolism here,  Sanders said.  That little bird is really a dove asking us for world peace. This sent the crowd into uproar, and the meme-makers went into overdrive.There was some speculation about what would have happened to the poor bird if it had innocently flapped its way into a Trump rally.@politico If this was a Trump rally.. his goons would beat it up or one of the cult members would shoot it  Greg King (@Megreg916) March 25, 2016And the whole affair is certainly not going to help Portland rid itself of the Portlandia gag #PutABirdOnIt.A little bird told me that @BernieSanders is really a Disney Princess.Also Portland you're taking that #PutABirdOnIt thing way too serious  kelly kapowski (@Colo_Kelly) March 25, 2016For those who missed that joke.

              "      <th>There seems to be a definite double standard when it comes to how Republicans in Congress want to go about investigating terrible governors. When it came to investigating former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber (D), Republicans like Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) were fast and furious with their requests to obtain the information they wanted in regards to a scandal surrounding Oregon s health insurance exchange. However, when it comes to going after Republican Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan over the horrendous Flint water crisis, those same Republicans so adamant at going after a Democratic governor, failed to send requests to investigate Flint.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) is not about to let them get away with this hypocrisy whatsoever.In a letter sent by Cummings to Chaffetz, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Cummings points out the clear double-standard of the committee going after Kitzhaber, but not Snyder in the same regard. And while Cummings does give them some credit for called Snyder before the Committee in March, it is clear that they are not going after Snyder with the same vigor. Cummings wrote: During our meeting last week, you explained that you had spoken directly with Governor Snyder, and you suggested that one reason not to request documents from him is because he might claim that his communications about the Flint water crisis are protected by executive privilege. Although I was not a part of your conversation with Governor Snyder, any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from Congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the Governor s own promises of accountability to the people of Michigan. Cummings also wrote: I believe that the Committee should apply the same standards for requesting documents to all governors, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. By declining to send any document request at all to Governor Snyder, the Committee is creating the perception of a double-standard in which it has requested documents from a Democratic governor, but not from a Republican governor. He then goes on to give the example of former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber.It is simply woefully irresponsible to so blatantly neglect going after Gov. Snyder, especially considering the Flint, Michigan water crisis is so irreversibly severe causing lifelong health issues to those affected. Not only should they be investigating Snyder to the fullest extent, but they should be pushing for his resignation, as is what happened with Kitzhaber.Cummings sums it up best when he states: The Committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation, and we should not do so now. Governor Snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision-making process that led to the poisoning of Flint residents, and the Committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation. Snyder needs to be held responsible and party politics need to be checked at the door. End of story.Featured image via YouTube</th>\n",

              "      <th>Chris Cuomo SLAMS Trump For Promising “A Lot Of Things That Can’t Be Done” In Energy Speech (VIDEO)</th>\n",
              "      <th>Earlier this week, Donald Trump made a speech in Bismarck, North Dakota to talk about his energy policy. While it might have been refreshing for the business mogul to actually talk about a policy instead of attacking his Democratic rivals, saying offensive things about women and minorities or retweeting white supremacists, it s safe to say Trump s supporters should hold off on getting too excited over anything he says   because it s all false promises.During Trump s speech, Trump promised American voters that he would cancel the crucial 2015 Paris agreement that binds all nations to the common goal of tackling climate change, and that he d  rescind  the EPA rules that President Barack Obama set up to decrease emissions from coal-fired power plants. If it sounds improbable, that s because it pretty much is   and no one was faster to point this out that CNN s Chris Cuomo on Friday. In speaking with Trump s campaign senior advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Cuomo criticized the GOP candidate for his sloppy ideas. He said: Donald Trump put out a big speech about his energy policy, about coal, about oil, about regulation. And the criticism of it is that he proposed a lot of things that can t be done. You can t get rid of all of the EPA regulations. You can t just make coal as huge as it once was. There are good and bad reasons for that. Fair criticisms that the proposal can t do what Donald Trump says it will do. Huckabee Sanders argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has to be  reined in and brought back down.  She said: I think there are some big things you can do, and exactly what Donald Trump said is we need to move to an all-of-the-above approach. The Obama administration and his energy policy has been job-killing, [has] raised energy costs across America, has been horrible for our country, so we ve got to go back to where we put all options on the table. Huckabee Sanders continued to diss Obama and added that, We ve got to absolutely reverse what has taken place over the last eight years under the Obama administration by taking away the energy independence that Americans have enjoyed and making us more dependent on foreign energy and go back to where we can energize our own country on our own. Cuomo fired back, stating that the EPA wasn t perfect, just like  every government agency.  He continued: But reducing fossil fuel dependence is a very popular thing in America, and that s a big part of the regulations, and in terms of energy independence, the United States right now puts out 74 percent of its oil needs. I mean, I guess you could go to 100 percent, but the idea that we re somehow, you know, really deficient in terms of how much of our own needs we provide for, it s just not true.  Huckabee Sanders continued to try and counter attack, but Cuomo shut her down every time with realistic scenarios and facts. You can watch Cuomo blast Trump s policies below: Trump s energy policy speech came just a day before Trump told drought-stricken Californians that the extreme water shortage they ve been experiencing doesn t really exist, and offered a conspiracy theory as an alternative explanation. Clearly, Trump isn t someone that we can trust for environmental or energy issues.Featured image is a screenshot</th>\n",

              "      <th>Who doesn t love Leslie Knope? She even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian Ron Swanson.Parks and Recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in America, in fact   especially millennials. And no character is more beloved than Amy Poehler s Leslie Knope.For many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly Knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. However, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. You can read my favorite passage below:Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron s words)  significant.  My bargaining was short, but creative  I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but I didn t care, in that moment.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to Acceptance. And here s what I stand on that:No. I do not accept it.I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the President. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I m pissed, and I m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) Our President-Elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.I highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   Leslie is exactly right. It s time for us to fight harder than ever.</th>\n",

              "      <th>Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton had a couple of really enthusiastic supporters show up at her Buena Park, California rally on Wednesday. In fact, they were so enthusiastic she had to stop her security team from throwing them out of the event because they decided to remove their shirts.As security moved to escort the shirtless men out of her rally, one of them yelled,  Hillary, they re kicking us out because we don t have our shirts on. They re making us leave because we don t have shirts on.  A laughing Clinton responded by asking security to stop and saying: Well, you know what? As long as they don t take anything else off. You know, you gotta make split decisions that s what leadership is all about. We are a big diverse country. OK, where was I? I gotta admit, it is a little distracting standing up here looking at them. So I m gonna look over this way, and I m gonna look over that way. I m gonna look back there. It was a great moment for Clinton to show off the sense of humor a lot of people do not realize she has. The right wing often accuses her of being an Ice Queen, but she is actually very funny. Her response also highlighted the vast differences between her campaign and that of Republican nominee Donald Trump. The GOP candidate s rallies are filled with violence and hate, while Clinton s is filled with positivity. It s like night and day.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot</th>\n",
